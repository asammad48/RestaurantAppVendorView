# Restaurant Management System

## Overview

This is a full-stack restaurant and hotel management application built with React/TypeScript frontend and Express.js backend.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Technical preferences:
- Use dummy/mock data instead of database connections
- Remove API endpoints and render data directly from React components
- UI styling: Order buttons should have gray background matching tables
- Services: "Free Services" should be labeled as "Services"
- Remove edit/delete buttons from all service cards (including paid services) 
- Table modals: Fix duplicate close buttons, edit modal should only allow editing seating capacity and assignee
- Menu section: Menu and category buttons should have gray background, only down border, highlighted items have green border
- Add Table button should be green
- Deals table: Remove checkboxes, add edit/delete context menu functionality
- Apply Discount modal: Should have only one close button
- Menu and category context menus: Add edit/delete buttons with proper functionality
